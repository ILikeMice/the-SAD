# The SAD (search annoyance department)

![Thumbnail image](./images/thumbnail.jpg)

At the SAD, we specialize in making your usage of the internet as ~~bad~~ great as it possibly can be by creating the ~~worst~~ best extensions and hardware products you will ever need/use.

## Usage

Idk, figure it out urself or smth

<sub><sup>To make it work, globaly disable CSP, the protection system, yes</sup></sub>

## Fun facts

* The last ~2 hours of the project were spent debugging and trying to make the extension work again (we only got it working ~10 minutes before the deadline)

* The submission video was recorded in one take ~5 minutes before the submission deadline
